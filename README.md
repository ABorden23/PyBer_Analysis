# PyBer Analysis

# Backround

 PyBer, a ride-sharing app company valued at $2.3 billion. You've just been assigned your first big project: analyze all the rideshare data from January to early May of 2019 and create a compelling visualization for the CEO, V. Isualize.

Using your Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib, you’ll create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. 

Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, you’ll create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. 

Finally, you’ll submit a written report that summarizes how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.

# Overview of the Analysis

This analysis was conducted to identifying the most profitable areas of ride sharing data in Rural, Suburban, Urban areas. 




# Results

In the conclusion of this analysis we have found in our data three different sightings.

Urban areas have the most drivers with the least average fare per driver and the most total rides.

Rural areas have the least drivers with the most average fare per driver and the least total rides.

Suburban areas sit in the middle of these statistics.

# Summary

Three Recomendations for the CEO

* Increase marketing efforts in Rural areas to attract more drivers to increase toal fares.
* Offer double fare earnings opportunities to drivers in Urban areas during peak ridesharing hours to maximize total fares.
* During late Febuary and early April offer sign on bonuses to new drivers to increase overall fares.
